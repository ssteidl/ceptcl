Changes leading up to 0.4:
* Removed -peereid [fconfigure] option; the values now show up in the -sockname and -peername options.
* Improved handling of local paths. Options -peername and -sockname now return a list consisting of the name used to open the local cep, the fully normalized and resolved pathname and a list consisting of the euid and egid of the connecting process.
* Major cleanup, removed _ANSI_ARGS_ and much older and nonneeded code.
* Added code to use poll() or kqueue() instead of select(), if desired.
* Fixed bug that would cause a crash if an error occurred inside a srrver 'accept' proc.
* Misc fixes, comments, changes, moose calibration, cleanups, etc.
