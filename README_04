New for Ceptcl 0.4:

* Major cleanup.
* Bug removal.
* Local names handled properly.
* New/changed [fconfigure] options.
* New [resolve] command for all your name resolution needs.
* Better datagramming
	Use [cepPuts] and [cepRead] for proper workingness.
	Commands [puts], [gets] and [read] can still be used
		and mixing them with the cep versions works
		somewhat, I think - but you really shouldn't
		be doing that.
* New [cepPassChannel] command allows passing Tcl channels
	over local ceps to other processes.
* Practically no new documentation whatsoever!
	Check out some of the example scripts.
* 8.5 enforced.
* Newer TEA.
* It should all or mostly work.
* Plan is to have a cleaned-up, documented version 0.5 in early 2009.
